        Hi! I’m Mohammad Heidari, a full-stack developer with over 5 years of experience in the fascinating world of coding 💻. I spend most of my time working as a freelancer and also collaborating with professional teams in companies 🤝. I always try to keep a good balance between quality, simplicity, and speed ⚖️.
        <br><br>
        Along this path, I’ve learned that just writing code isn’t enough; what matters more is how well you coordinate with your team, how well you listen 👂, and how you find real solutions for real problems 🔍. My GitHub projects are part of my world—where I test my ideas, build tools, and grow 🌱.
        <br>
        When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me with a cup of coffee ☕, sitting in front of a quiet, heavy night 🌙—where the silence feels like a kind of bitter strength 💪.
        <br><br>
        I believe in continuous learning 📚 and creating things that make people’s lives better ✨.
        <br>
        If building precisely, thoughtfully, and meaningfully matters to you, maybe someday our paths will cross 🔗.
